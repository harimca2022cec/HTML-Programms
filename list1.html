<p><i><h3 style="color:#ff7a59;text-align:justify;font-family:times new roman;">Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. 
Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; 
in fact, humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.</p></i></h3>
