<p><i><h3 style="color:#ff7a59;text-align:justify;font-family:times new roman;">A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in flowering plants (plants of the division Angiospermae).
 The biological function of a flower is to facilitate reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs.
 Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population)
 resulting from cross-pollination or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower) when self-pollination occurs.
