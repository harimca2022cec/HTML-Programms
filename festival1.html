<p><i><h3 style="color:#6f124d;text-align:justify;font-family:times new roman";>Diwali (also: Deepawali) is one of India's biggest festivals.
 The word 'Deepawali' means rows of lighted lamps. It is a Festival of Lights and Hindus celebrate it with joy.
 During this festival, people light up their houses and shops with Diyas (small cup-shaped oil lamp made of baked clay).
 They worship the Lord Ganesha for welfare and prosperity and Goddess Lakshmi for wealth and wisdom.</p></i></h3>
